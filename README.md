## About

The purpose of our website is to provide the most unique experience to our users, and to make a workout more simple, functional, and fun. We offer a big amount of possible exercise and routines for every day, the possibility to check your account, and also search, find and practice the new routines that we provide.

## Usage

Allows users to login/register for an account in our database. They can then use our API to search for workouts by equipment, target a body part, or even a muscle group. Then the user will be able to save workouts to their account in our saved workouts tab for future use to create a workout routine.
